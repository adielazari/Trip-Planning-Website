# Trip-Planning-Website
We design and implement an internet site on both sides - server side in node.js and client side in angularjs environment. In the first step, we wear the product manager's hat, which receives specifications from the customer and is required to plan an implementation for the site. In the second step is the server side programmer hat, where we accept and implement the api proposal (we created). In the third stage, the client side programmer's cap, where we accept the api proposal and use it to realize the client side. We created the database in Azure.  The project is a set of information on various tourist and interest sites in the capital of Israel - Jerusalem. We call them "points of interest" that will allow users to search for popular places to visit in the city and keep these items intact for use during their trip (save to favorites). Points of interest can be - historical sites, attractions, museums, restaurants, nightclubs, major shopping centers and the like.
